# Firebase Authentication Domain Authorization Fix

## Issue
The application was experiencing `Firebase: Error (auth/unauthorized-domain)` when trying to authenticate from certain domains, particularly during development and deployment.

## Solution
We've implemented enhanced error handling and domain detection to provide clear guidance on resolving Firebase domain authorization issues.

## What Was Added

### 1. Domain Utilities (`src/config/domains.js`)
- Automatic detection of current domain and environment
- List of common domains that need Firebase authorization
- Helper functions to identify potentially unauthorized domains

### 2. Enhanced Firebase Configuration (`src/config/firebase.js`)
- Improved error logging with domain information
- Direct links to Firebase Console for easy configuration
- Utility functions for domain troubleshooting

### 3. Enhanced Authentication Error Handling (`src/components/Auth/AuthModal.jsx`)
- User-friendly error messages for domain authorization issues
- Visual indicators when domain authorization is likely the problem
- Direct link to Firebase Console with project-specific URL
- Clear instructions on how to add domains to Firebase

## How to Fix Domain Authorization Issues

### For Developers
1. **Open Firebase Console**: Use the "Open Firebase Console" button in the error message
2. **Navigate to Authentication Settings**: Go to Authentication → Settings → Authorized domains
3. **Add Required Domains**:
   - `localhost` (for local development)
   - `127.0.0.1` (alternative localhost)
   - Your deployment domains (e.g., `yourapp.vercel.app`, `yourapp.netlify.app`)

### Common Authorized Domains Needed
```
localhost
127.0.0.1
yourproject.vercel.app
yourproject.netlify.app
yourdomain.com
```

### For Production Deployments
Ensure these domains are added to Firebase Console:
- Your production domain (e.g., `example.com`)
- Your deployment platform domain (e.g., `yourapp.vercel.app`)
- Any staging/preview domains

## Error Messages
The enhanced error handling now provides:
- Clear indication when domain authorization is the issue
- Current domain information for debugging
- Direct link to Firebase Console
- Step-by-step instructions

## Testing
To test the domain authorization:
1. Try signing in with Google from an unauthorized domain
2. You should see enhanced error messages with domain information
3. Click "Open Firebase Console" to quickly access the settings
4. Add your domain to the authorized domains list

## Benefits
- ✅ Clearer error messages for developers
- ✅ Faster problem resolution with direct Firebase Console links
- ✅ Better user experience during development
- ✅ Automatic domain detection and suggestions
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation and guidance
